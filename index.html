<p>** PS3 Flash Writer for HFW 4.90 **</p>
<p></p>
<p>Official HFW 4.90.1 is required. You only need to install it once.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This is an unofficial update by lmn7 of the old PS3Xploit html/js Writer. He recommends to self-host the files locally. It is being hosted here for those people who can not do so. It can save a flash dump to USB storage device before writing. Keep the dump file in a safe place! Click <a href="https://www.psx-place.com/threads/ps3xploit-flash-writer-4-90-hfw.39744/">HERE<a> for the release thread.</p>
<p></p>
<p>If the tool says that your PS3 is not CFW-compatable, you can still use HEN!</p>
